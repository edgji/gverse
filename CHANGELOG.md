### Version pre-1-1

##### Gverse types have been dropped in favor of Dgraph System

##### Clasess broken into multiple files. You can now import individual classes:

```typescript
import { Connection } from "gverse/connect"
```

The old way still works as well:

```typescript
import Gverse from "gverse"
```
